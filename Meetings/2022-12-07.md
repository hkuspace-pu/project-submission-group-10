## Impediments (Problems)
1. Need improve the admin role functions.
2. Redesign the database structure for the further action requirement.
3. Some functions can be merge for a clear view.
4. Do we need so many roles? Its possible the client isn't to sure about the role requirements between moderator and professional surveyor, they could be the same archetype? We want to avoid redundancy &  scope creep as set out in our initial Product Plan.
5. Client asked for user engagement, points should not be offered unless a survey is approved by a moderator or administrator.
