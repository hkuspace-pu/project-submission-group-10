## Future Actions
- Deploy all of the above to the product backlog
- Plan sprint weeks for certain high profile todo items

# Tech stack
- Tech stack is yet to be confirmed, possible options are :
  - Web based single code base responsive application (Vue JS/React/Angular)
  - Java backend for the API
  - MariaDB Database. 

## What we learned (Knowledge)
1.The personas of the users for our application, we now have a clearer idea of the context of use.
2.What kind of role will appear in the system.
3.How to design the UI flow based on the clients review of our Low Fidelity Prototype

# Impediments (Problems)
- We overran our meeting, due to poor planning, hence we weren’t able to adequately gauge the client’s feedback on our paper based mockup.
- We failed to allow the client to interact with our mockup, rather we guided her ourselves which may be insufficient to gauge appropriate feedback.
- However enough high-level feedback was given on our aspects that will help us better prepare for our next meeting.
- Need improve the admin role functions.
- Redesign the database structure for the further action requirement.
- Some functions can be merge for a clearer view
- Do we need so many roles? Its possible the client isn't to sure about the role requirements between moderator and professional surveyor, they could be the same archetype? We want to avoid redundancy &  scope creep as set out in our initial Product Plan.
- Client asked for user engagement, points should not be offered unless a survey is approved by a moderator or administrator.
