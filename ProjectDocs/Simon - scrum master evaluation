My role is scrum master, I created the tasks at git product backlog. At the start, I design to use monday.com for marking the working schedule. As it can set the time time, status, and assignees. It will help to manage the tasks well. After a month, the free trial ended. Our group did a discuss keep using it or not. As our client did not have enough budget, is better to move to another platform. Because of the monday.com situation, I understand the need for comparing more platforms and find the most acceptable one. And I told my team about my comparison and suggestion. I had two options, one is TeamGantt, and the other is GitHub. TeamGantt like monday.com, can set the tasks, assigned, and working schedule. The limit is only can create 200 tasks and there is one editor only. For GitHub, the difference is it can not set up a working schedule. Finally, we use GitHub's product backlog as the platform for reviewing our work and they can create tasks if needed. As we do not know how many tasks will have and GitHub can set the priority for tasks. It is easier to follow up. And TeamGantt has the sprint project plan, although they can not edit it, TeamGantt has a clearer display of the schedule.
In the beginning, I assigned tasks to my teammates. I marked down the website page name as the title of the task. But I didn't explain the tasks clearly and had insufficient content, my teammates do not understand what I want to do, although we had met before. After their reminder and suggestion, I know the contents are quite vague, is better to list the tasks according to functions, bugs, and layouts. It will be easy to follow and will not forget. After the meeting, we decided what we will present to the client in the next meeting. Based on the meeting, I updated the priority of tasks for my team to follow. In the product backlog, I learned I had to be the one who fully understand what the project doing and make sure it is on schedule. If I miss understanding some features or flow, our project may move the wrong way. My teammates may work on the tasks with low priority and let our client be a disappointment.
