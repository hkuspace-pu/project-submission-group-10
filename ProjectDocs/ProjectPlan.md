### PROJECT VISION
To realize our client's goals in developing and implementing a Natural science survey system with a primary focus on the surveying and data retrieval of tree species. This new system aims to replace the current antiquated paper-based recording and the problems that arise with manual data entry. 

Our vision is to enable key stakeholders, namely, researchers and the general public, a sense of pride and love of nature surrounding Hong Kong's diverse flora.

### LIST OF NON TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES
- Ensure the delivery of a high-quality system within the project scope.
- To create productivity gains over the current paper-based implementation.
- Create secure & privacy-compliant software that meets local regulatory and ethical standards.
- Create a visually compelling, high learnability interface based on client feedback
- To increase adoption and usage of the software through gamification.

## RISK MANAGAMENT PLAN

### BUDGET RISK
  - Given that this is a project for an NGO with a minimal budget, we are mandated to keep our costs as low as possible while delivering a high-quality product. Thus a heavy reliance on team cooperation and work ethic are of utmost importance while keeping the budget low.

### SOlUTION
   - Using open source software and off-the-shelf products to design and implement the software without a burdening expense.

### SCOPE CREEP
  - Scope creep is a phenomenon of the software development lifecycle; it happens when the client adds features that were not already discussed at the planning stage, thus increasing the cost and workload for our team and may push deadlines beyond the time limit set.

### SOLUTION
  - Regular client meetings are necessary to ensure that plans are followed strictly to avoid scope creep. All stakeholders must be in agreement to the product backlog and the features that are required. Small and trivial additional features are usually acceptable.

### TIME CONSTRAINTS
  - Deadlines are often difficult to stick to due to the very nature of the software development lifecycle. Improper time management and lack of talent are several factors that can push deadlines and affect the completion of work.

### SOLUTION
 - By using agile methodologies and sticking to deadlines for software releases as well as keeping a time buffer should alleviate most of the time delays that we may experien
 - 
### EXTERNAL FACTORS
  - Face-to-face client meetings may be hindered due to the current Covid-19 pandemic and the restrictions that are still present in Hong Kong. While some of the restrictions have been lifted, they have yet to be totally removed.
### SOLUTION
  - Channels of communication such as Slack, Zoom will be utilized if incase such face-to-face meetings cannot take place, although meeting clients face to face is a preferred choice to obtain valuable feedback.
